# Heicoder AI 200 Capstone Project
<b>Context:</b>
- This project was completed as part of a 2-man team capstone project for the Heicoders AI200 - Applied Machine Learning Course. 
- For this capstone, the dataset is modified from the LendingClub dataset, and our task was autonomously select features and create a machine learning model to predict which loans are likely to default.
- We are free to use any ensemble ML algorithms and to do our own EDA/feature engineering.
- The evaluation metric for the models is **AUC** and we are encouraged to do our own hyperparameter tuning

<b>Objective:</b>
- Predicting loan defaults on the LendingClub Dataset.

<b>Dataset Used:</b>
- LendingClub Loan Default Dataset from Kaggle
